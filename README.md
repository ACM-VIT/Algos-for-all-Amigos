## Overview

This year we've introduced a whole range of new topics that can be taken up by newbies and seasoned professionals
alike! There is something for everyone to work on, as we have issues in Web Development, Machine Learning, 
Advanced Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Automata Theory, Graph Theory, Deep Learning, Linear Algebra and even Assembly Level Programming.

### Choosing an Issue

You don't need to be an expert in any of these topics to start. Just pick one that suits you and
start coding!

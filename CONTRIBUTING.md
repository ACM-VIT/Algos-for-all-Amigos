Please adhere to the following convention while naming files - <br>
Filename = p[number]_[name of file].extension <br>
The number succeeding 'p' should correspond to the number in the table or its respective filetree. <br>

For example: <br>
Bike Dataset for Classification is named as: p1_Bike_Data.csv <br>
All the Machine Learning Classification Algos that work on this dataset share the same initial filename (i.e. 'p1' ) <br>
